		<h1> What does being Healthy mean? </h1>

			<p> Being healthy should not be having the same body as your favorite celebrity or starving yourself everyday to lose weight. You should eat until you are satisfied, but eat the foods that are healthy and will promote a sustainable  amazing lifestyle. For example, 400 calories worth of chips will not make you feel as good as 400 calories worth of fruit or vegetables </p>

			<p> Healthy carbs such as potatoes, rice, and fruit will help to shed excess fat. Your cells run on glucose and seek the sugar that is inside of these carbs. There are many unhealthy carbs in chips, cookies, and junk foods. These should be avoided. </p>
		</div>

		<div class= "col-xs-6" style="background-color:red;" >
		<p> It is okay to have foods that are high in fat or not healthy once in a while. You never want to deprive yourself from a food that you genuinely enjoy. However, eat any food in moderation. Whether it is healthy or not, do not eat when you are not hungry. </p>
